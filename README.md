# Bamazon

## Description

Bamazon is the low-budget version of Amazon that can be used to pretend to purchase common items.

## Motivation
This tool was created as part of the University of Richmond Full Stack Flex Web Development program curriculum to further databasing skills using mySQL. It is useful for those who want to learn more about an artist's next concert, a movie or a song.

## Tech Used
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- JSON Packages (mysql & inquirer)
- mySQL
This tool was created using a JavaScript file to pull information from the JSON packages and display it to the user then use inquirer to receive information on what the user would want from the premade items in the database.
